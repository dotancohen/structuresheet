# StructureSheet

[StructureSheet](https://github.com/dotancohen/structuresheet) is a structured spreadsheet application backed by a strongly-typed SQLite database.

StructreSheet is _not_ a [database editor](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), rather it is intended to replace spreadsheets such as [MS Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/excel) in applications where users might not [be careful with datatypes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30986329). For people who are aware of the pitfalls of MS Excel and meticulous about configuring it properly, StructreSheet provides no additional benefits.
